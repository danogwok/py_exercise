******QUESTION

Create a class called BankAccount

    Create a constructor that takes in an integer and assigns this to a `balance` property.
    Create a method called `deposit` that takes in cash deposit amount and updates the balance accordingly.
    Create a method called `withdraw` that takes in cash withdrawal amount and updates the balance accordingly. if amount is greater than balance return `"invalid transaction"`
    Create a subclass MinimumBalanceAccount of the BankAccount class



*****THE TEST

import unittest
class AccountBalanceTestCases(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.my_account = BankAccount(90)
    
  def test_balance(self):
    self.assertEqual(self.my_account.balance, 90, msg='Account Balance Invalid')
    
  def test_deposit(self):
    self.my_account.deposit(90)
    self.assertEqual(self.my_account.balance, 180, msg='Deposit method inaccurate')
    
  def test_withdraw(self):
    self.my_account.withdraw(40)
    self.assertEqual(self.my_account.balance, 50, msg='Withdraw method inaccurate')
    
  def test_invalid_operation(self):
    self.assertEqual(self.my_account.withdraw(1000), "invalid transaction", msg='Invalid transaction')
  
  def test_sub_class(self):
    self.assertTrue(issubclass(MinimumBalanceAccount, BankAccount), msg='No true subclass of BankAccount')



THE CLASS BACKACCOUNT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS ALL THE TESTS.
it has played me.
